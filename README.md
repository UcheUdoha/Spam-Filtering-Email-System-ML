# Spam Filtering Email System using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Spam Filtering Email System** using **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Regression**, and a **Perceptron Classifier**. By applying machine learning algorithms, the system classifies emails as spam or non-spam based on specific features extracted from email datasets.

## Features:
- **Data Acquisition:** Utilized publicly available datasets from AWS and Kaggle for spam email classification.
- **Model Development:** Implemented three classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression for binary classification.
  - Linear Regression for continuous data analysis.
  - Perceptron Classifier for a baseline model.
- **Unit Testing:** Thorough unit testing of all classifiers to ensure accurate results.
- **Visualization:** Performance metrics and results visualized in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (for model development and testing).
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for environment setup and visualization).
- **Scikit-learn** (for implementing machine learning algorithms).
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** (for data manipulation).
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data visualization).

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `spam_filtering.ipynb`.
4. Review unit test results and performance metrics.

## Results:
The Logistic Regression model showed higher accuracy in detecting spam emails compared to Linear Regression and the Perceptron Classifier. The performance metrics for each model are outlined in the projectâ€™s notebook.

## Future Improvements:
- Experiment with other classification models like **Random Forest** or **SVM** for better accuracy.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to improve spam detection.
- Implement real-time filtering capabilities in email services.
